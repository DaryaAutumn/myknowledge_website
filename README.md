# My Knowledge Website

This is a project representing a webside with info about some musical groups. It is created with my coworker who is the author of all info. Try it yorself!

# How to install?

1. Go to `Code` green button and choose `Download ZIP`

2. As soon as archive is downloaded unzip it and create a folder on your computer

3. Run file 'index.html' and enjoy!

This steps should be followed as long as you want to get access to the code of the website (and as long as there is no public link). Public link is coming soon! I'll try to push this website on some public host when it's ready.

# As soon as you've got project folder on your computer...

Project is in process now so there must be more commits with essensial changes and updates. To stay tuned do this steps:

1. Go to your folder with project. Click on it to show context menu and chooe 'Open in terminal'

2. Now you're ready to enter some commands! Go with ``git status`` Until it says "Your branch is up to date with 'main/main'" everything is okay, in other cases you should go with ``git pull``
